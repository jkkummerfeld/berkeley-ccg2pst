This software converts Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) derivations to Phrase Structure Trees (PST).  For a full description of the method, and discussion of results, see:

## Running the code

On a sample of CCGbank:
```
./convert.py sample.gold_ptb sample.ccgbank -print_comparison -prefix=sample.ccgbank -verbose -method=markedup ./markedup
```

On a sample of C&C Parser output:
```
./convert.py sample.gold_ptb sample.candc -print_comparison -prefix=sample.candc -verbose -method=markedup ./markedup
```

Conversion output will be in:
```
sample.ccgbank.auto
sample.candc.auto
```

The code also comes with a sample of parses from the Penn Treebank section 00,
the corresponding parses from CCGbank section 00, and the C&C parser output on
the same sentences.
